  <p>Collusion is an experimental add-on for Firefox and allows you to see all the third parties that are tracking your movements across the Web. It will show, in real time, how that data creates a spider-web of interaction between companies and other trackers.</p>

    <h3>Take control of your data</h3>
    <p>We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and with information. The Ford Foundation and Mozilla have teamed up to develop Collusion into a fully functioning feature for Firefox - that will enable users to not only see who is tracking them across the Web, but also to turn that tracking off when they want to.</p>

    <h3>Telling the global tracking story</h3>
    <p>Your data can be part of the larger story.  When we launch the full version of Collusion, it will allow you to opt-in to sharing your anonymous data in a global database of web tracker data. We’ll combine all that information and make it available to help researchers, journalists, and others analyze and explain how data is tracked on the web.</p>

    <h3>Building user awareness</h3>
    <p>Through our work with the Ford Foundation, we’ll be building outreach campaigns to help people understand online data tracking — both the benefits and the issues — so they can make their own choices about how they want to be tracked (or choose not to be tracked at all).</p>

    <h3>Collusion is about choice</h3>
    <p>Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But most tracking happens without user’s consent and without their knowledge. That’s not okay. It should be you who decides when, how and if you want to be tracked. Collusion will be a powerful tool to help you do that.</p>
