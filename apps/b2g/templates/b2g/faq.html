  <h1>Boot to Gecko FAQ</h1>

  <dl>
    <dt>What is Boot to Gecko?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Boot to Gecko (B2G) is an implementation of new web standards that bring the power  of the open web to mobile devices, unencumbered by the rules and  restrictions of existing proprietary platforms.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>What is the overall aim of the project? What problems are you solving?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We believe that the next frontier for Web applications is full device integration, so that web developers have the same capabilities as those building for OS-specific stacks. Boot to Gecko is intended to  identify those missing device capabilities and other application needs,  and design standardized solutions for app developers to use.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>What is the size of the team working on this project?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>More than 20 engineers were working full-time on B2G-specific parts of the system (telephony, messaging, system-level phone integration). In addition to Mozilla contributors, engineers from  carrier partners are working jointly with us on the project.</p>
      <p>We are leaning heavily on the existing Gecko and Firefox mobile work and the team of hundreds of engineers building those products. 95% of the code in B2G is shared with Firefox.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>What does B2G mean for your relationships with Apple, Google and Microsoft?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We don't expect that it will affect our relationships with other organizations.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>Does this replace work that's already being done on Web APIs for desktop and mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We are already pushing hard on new Web APIs and will continue to implement and standardize new APIs for Web content while the B2G project ramps up.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>How is this different than the Webian Shell project?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The Webian Shell project is an impressive project even in its early  stages. Where Webian is focused on a Web-centric desktop experience,  we're focused on extending the Web to include more of what is  traditionally the domain of OS-specific code. We think we can work  together on a bunch of things, and we're looking forward to it.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>How is this different from Chrome OS?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We’re aiming at mobile/tablet devices rather than a notebook form  factor. This is an early-stage project to expose all device  capabilities such that infrastructure like phone dialers can be built  with Web APIs, and not only “high level” apps like word processors and  presentation software.</p>
      <p>We will of course be happy to work with the  Chrome OS team on standards activities, and indeed to share source code  where appropriate.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>Do you see B2G as co-existing with other mobile OSes, or competing with them?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Ideally, the technology pioneered or refined in B2G will make its  way into all mobile browsers, so that enhanced open Web applications  can be great regardless of operating system or device. We look forward  to working with other OS and browser developers on standards activities  and even implementations.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>Are OEMs interested in B2G?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Currently B2G is still a project without a firm product schedule.  We are briefing silicon vendors (ODMs), OEMs and carriers on B2G, and  we will announce a product schedule and launch partners once we reach  that stage.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>Whose hardware will you support?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We are currently using off-the shelf developer hardware (Samsung  Galaxy S 2), because the device is commercially available to Mozilla  employees and community members. We will port B2G to a reference  platform once we have identified the ODM/OEM that will ship the first  B2G device. That reference platform will likely be very different than  the Samsung Galaxy S 2.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>Is B2G just introducing yet another platform for devs to code for?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>No, B2G is definitely not designed to be another platform. It's a  project to extend what developers can do with the Web, especially in  the context of mobile devices, and to do so in a way that leads to  interoperable standards.</p>
      <p>Just as with HTML5, ES5, CSS3 and other Web  technology it will reach different browsers and operating systems at  different times, but the pace of Web platform development gives us  confidence that good Web technology can reach a lot of people pretty  quickly.</p>
      <p>We don't want B2G to lead to applications that only run atop  B2G, or only run in Firefox. That's an important difference between what  we're doing and proprietary mobile stacks today: we don't want a  competitive advantage for Mozilla, we want a competitive advantage for  the Web.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>How do you think you'll get the mobile manufacturers and carriers on board with this?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>B2G is designed to build on the success of the Web, and given the  early stage of the project it could reach users in many forms. We're  working with ODMs, OEMs, carriers and others who share our vision of  even greater success for Web-based applications.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>What does B2G offer mobile users that HTML5 doesn't?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>B2G offers mobile users all the power of HTML5, extended with device capabilities like Bluetooth and SMS, a richer capability model for interaction with the filesystem, and a way to tie native HTML5 apps together. 
The intent is very much that B2G lead to  improved capabilities for the Web platform, not that it replace HTML5 or  related tech in any way. Many of these new capabilities will also make  sense in desktop browsers, and we look forward to seeing them there as  well.
</p>
</dd>

    <dt>Will this mean a Firefox Phone?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We don’t have any plans to build or distribute a custom device.</p>
</dd>

    <dt>I am a web developer. How do I deploy my web application to the B2G platform?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>You don't. By default, your web app will be accessible from the phone just like any other website. If you want to make it installable to the homescreen, you may consider adding an open web app manifest to your app. However, the install API is not complete yet on the B2G platform as of Jan 2012.</p>
