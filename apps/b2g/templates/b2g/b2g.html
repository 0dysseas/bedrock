      <h3>Opportunities for Developers</h3>
      <p>Developers no longer need to learn and develop against platform-specific native APIs. Using HTML5 and B2G's standards-based APIs, developers everywhere can create amazing experiences and apps that are accessible from any Web device.</p>

      <h3>Customization for OEMs & Operators</h3>
      <p>OEMs and operators can provide content and services across their entire device portfolio, regardless of OS. They can customize user experiences, manage app distribution and retain customer attention, loyalty and billing relationships.</p>

      <h3>Consumer Freedom</h3>
      <p>Consumers who use devices with an open mobile platform can easily access and download their own content regardless of which operating system it uses.</p>

      <h3>New Web Standards</h3>
      <p>Boot to Gecko is an implementation of new Web standards that brings the power of the open Web to mobile devices, unencumbered by the rules and restrictions of existing proprietary platforms.</p>

      <h3>Freedom From Proprietary Mobile Platforms</h3>
      <p>Today's proprietary mobile platforms are closely tied to specific devices and their development is tightly controlled by a single vendors.</p>
      <p>Carriers and developers write apps and services for one platform and then rewrite them for others. Users who want to buy phones, e-readers and game consoles from different manufacturers often need to re-purchase apps for each device.</p>
