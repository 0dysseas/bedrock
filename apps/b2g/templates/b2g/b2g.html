  <h1>Welcome to a new, open and powerful mobile world!</h1>
  <p>We launched the Boot to Gecko project to bring the power of the Open Web platform to mobile devices.  Weâ€™re making innovation more accessible by driving the development of new Web standards.</p>

      <h3>Opportunities for Developers</h3>
      <p>Developers no longer need to learn and develop against platform-specific native APIs. Using HTML5 and the Mozilla-proposed standard APIs, developers everywhere can create amazing experiences and apps that are accessible from any Web device.</p>

      <h3>Customization for OEMs & Operators</h3>
      <p>OEMs and operators can provide content and services across their entire device portfolio, regardless of OS. They can customize user experiences, manage app distribution and retain customer attention, loyalty and billing relationships.</p>

      <h3>Consumer Freedom</h3>
      <p>Consumers who use devices based on the Open Web platform can easily access and download their own content regardless of which operating system they use.</p>

      <h3>New Web Standards</h3>
      <p>The project will produce an implementation of these new Web standards to free mobile platforms from the encumbrances of the rules and restrictions of existing proprietary platforms.</p>

      <h3>Freedom From Proprietary Mobile Platforms</h3>
      <p>Carriers and developers write apps and services for one platform and then rewrite them for others. Users who want to buy phones, e-readers and game consoles from different manufacturers often need to re-purchase apps for each device.</p>
