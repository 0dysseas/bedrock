=======================================
Welcome to mozilla.org's documentation!
=======================================

**bedrock** is the code name of the new mozilla.org. It is bound to be as
shiny, awesome, and open sourcy as always. Perhaps even a little more.

bedrock is a web application based on Django_/Playdoh_.

Patches are welcome! Feel free to fork and contribute to this project on
Github_.

Interested in how PHP integrates with mozilla.org? The previous
version was written in PHP and still serves any page that hasn't been
migrated yet. :ref:`Look here <php>` for more information.
