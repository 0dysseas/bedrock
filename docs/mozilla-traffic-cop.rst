===================
Mozilla Traffic Cop
===================

`mozilla-traffic-cop.js` handles redirecting users to different A/B/x variations
through a query parameter.

**`mozilla-traffic-cop.js` requires `mozilla-cookie-helper.js`, which is included as
default in the `site.js` bundle for most pages.**

How It Works
------------

.. Important::

    The Traffic Cop will not initialize for users with DNT enabled.

After verifying the configuration, the Traffic Cop first makes sure the user is
not currently viewing a variation (to avoid a redirect loop). It then chooses a
random percentage (1-100).

If the percentage falls within the total percentage targeted by the config, it
will choose the appropriate variation and redirect the user.

If the percentage exceeds that of the config, no redirect will occur. (This
could be considered the "control".)

If a variation is chosen, a cookie is set (for the session only) that will
send the user back to the same variation if/when the page is again visited.

Any query string parameters present when a user initially lands on a page will be
propagated to the variation redirect.

Configuration
-------------

Each instance of the Traffic Cop requires two pieces of configuration:

- A string ID that is unique to other currently running tests (to avoid
confusion when reading cookies)
- A variations object that lists all variations by query string along with the
associated visitor percentage

An implementation might look like::

    var cop = new Mozilla.TrafficCop({
        id: 'exp_firefox_new_headline',
        variations: {
            'v=1': 25,
            'v=2': 25,
            'v=3': 25
        }
    });

    cop.init();

In the above example, the string `exp_firefox_new_headline` will be used as the
cookie name should a variation be chosen.

The test will have 3 variations, each targeting 25% of users.

How a Variation is Chosen
-------------------------

Variations are sorted in the order provided, and percentages are tallied to
create tiers. Take the following config::

    var cop = new Mozilla.TrafficCop({
        id: 'exp_firefox_new_headline',
        variations: {
            'v=c': 25,
            'v=a': 25,
            'v=f': 25
        }
    });

The implied tiers would be:

- v=c: 1-25
- v=a: 26-50
- v=f: 51-75
- (no redirect): 76-100

So, if the random percentage chosen was 44, the user would be redirected to
`v=a`.

Implementation
--------------

To add a Traffic Cop to a page, create a new JS bundle for the experiment that
includes:

- `mozilla-traffic-cop.js`
- A new JS file that configures and initializes the experiment

.. Important::

    Place this new bundle in the `experiments` block of the page, wrapped in a
    `switch` for easy enabling and disabling::

        {% block experiments %}
          {% if switch('experiment-firefox-new') %}
             {% javascript 'experiment-firefox-new' %}
          {% endif %}
        {% endblock %}

What It Doesn't Do
------------------

No further user segmentation is handled by the Traffic Cop. This means that any
locale, OS, browser, or other restrictions must be handled elsewhere - i.e. in
the configuration JS file. Commonly requested features will likely be added to
the library as usage dictates.
