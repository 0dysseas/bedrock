    More protection. <br>Less worry.

  <p>
    We’re obsessed with protecting your privacy. That’s why we’ve made Firefox’s private browsing more powerful than the others.

  <h3>Block Ads</h3>

  <p>
    Not only do trackers collect info, they can weigh down your browsing speeds. Only Firefox Private Browsing blocks ads with hidden trackers, so you can drop the baggage and browse freely.

{% block content_2 %}
  <h3>Block Tracking</h3>

  <p>
    Some websites and ads attach hidden trackers that collect your browsing info long after you’ve left. Only Firefox Private Browsing has tracking protection to block them automatically, so you can browse with peace of mind.

{% block content_3 %}
  <h3>Block Snoops</h3>

  <p>
    Sharing is caring, but that should be your call. Firefox Private Browsing automatically erases your online info like passwords, cookies, and history from your computer. So that when you close out, you leave no trace.
