  <h3>Bang for your bytes</h3>

  <p>
    No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. We also use less memory than Chrome, so it’s easier for your computer to keep running other programs without being weighed down.

  <h3>More privacy</h3>

  <p>
    We’re obsessed with protecting your privacy. That’s why we’ve made firefox private browsing more powerful than the others. Plus, Firefox doesn’t sell access to your personal information like other companies.

{% block content_3 %}
  <h3>No strings attached</h3>

  <p>
    Firefox is built by a non-profit. That means we can do things that others can’t, like build new products and features without a hidden agenda. We champion your right to privacy with tools like Private Browsing with Tracking Protection, which go beyond what Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge offer.
