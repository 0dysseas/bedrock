  <p><em>Version 2.4</em></p>

  <p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
    other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla may include with such software
    a default set of X.509v3 certificates for various Certification Authorities
    (CAs). The certificates included by default have their "trust bits" set for
    various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA certificates
    to verify certificates for SSL servers and S/MIME email users without having
    to ask users for further permission or information.</p>

  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for CA certificates that are distributed
    with Mozilla software products. This policy consists of the following
    sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#requirements">Audit Requirements</a></p>

      <p>Before being included and periodically thereafter, CAs are required to
        obtain certain audits. This section describes the requirements for those
        audits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#application">Applying for Inclusion of Root Certificates in Mozilla Products</a></p>

      <p>This section describes the obligations of Certification Authorities
        applying for inclusion of their root certificates in Mozilla Products.
        This includes considerations that are taken into account such as the CA’s
        publicly available documentation about their policies, and audits of the
        CA’s operations in support of the documented policies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#maintenance">Maintaining Confidence in Included Root Certificates</a></p>

      <p>This section describes the obligations of Certification Authorities for
        maintaining confidence in their root certificates that are included in
        Mozilla Products. This includes regular auditing of the CA’s policies and
        practices; conforming to current CA industry standards and recommended
        best practices; and making changes to included root certificates.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#enforcement">Enforcing the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a></p>

      <p>This section describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to enforce
        this policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and removing
        or disabling a root certificate.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition, Mozilla manages its root store using the Common CA Database
    (CCADB). CAs in the program are required to use the CCADB, and are bound by the
    <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pkipolicy/blob/2.4/ccadb/policy.md">Common CCADB Policy v1.0</a> and the
    <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pkipolicy/blob/2.4/ccadb/mozilla.md">Mozilla CCADB Policy v1.0</a>, which are incorporated here
    by reference.</p>

  <p>This policy applies only to software products distributed by Mozilla,
    including the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries. Other entities
    distributing such software are free to adopt their own policies. In
    particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors
    of such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates in the
    versions that they distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of
    the "trust bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. As with
    other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may affect
    its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its versions of the
    software; see the Mozilla trademark policy for more information.</p>

  <p>This policy applies, as appropriate, to certificates matching any of the
    following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>CA certificates applying for inclusion in, or included in, Mozilla Products.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Intermediate certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate and which are not technically constrained such
        that they are unable to issue working server or email certificates. Such
        technical constraints could consist of either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which does not contain either of the
          id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-emailProtection EKUs; or:</li>
        <li>name constraints which do not allow SANs of any of the following types:
          dNSName, iPAddress, SRVName, rfc822Name</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>End-entity certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up to
        such a CA certificate through intermediate certificates which are all in
        scope, such end-entity certificates having either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which contains one or more of the
          id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-emailProtection EKUs; or:</li>
        <li>no EKU extension.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please contact Mozilla at
    <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> for more
    information about this policy and answers to related questions.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We will do so only
    after consulting with the public Mozilla community, in order to ensure that
    all views are taken into account.</p>

  <h2 id="requirements">Audit Requirements</h2>

  <p>Before being included and periodically thereafter, CAs are required to
    obtain certain audits. This section describes the requirements for those
    audits.</p>

        event of inconsistency between Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy
        requirements and the Baseline Requirements, Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy
        takes precedence. Below is a list of known places where this policy takes
        precedence over the Baseline Requirements. If you find an
        inconsistency that is not listed here, notify Mozilla by sending
        email to <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> so the item can be considered.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy defining a competent and
          independent auditor is a superset of section 8.2 of the
          Baseline Requirements, and takes precedence over it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>By "competent party" we mean a person or other entity who is
        authorized to perform audits according to the stated criteria (e.g.,
        by the organization responsible for the criteria or by a relevant
        government agency) <em>or</em> for whom there is sufficient public
        information available to determine that the party is competent to
        judge the CA’s conformance to the stated criteria. In the latter
        case the "public information" referred to should include information
        regarding the party’s</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  knowledge of CA-related technical issues such as public key
          cryptography and related standards;</li>
        <li>  experience in performing security-related audits, evaluations,
          or risk analyses; <em>and</em>

        <li>  honesty and objectivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>By "independent party" we mean a person or other entity who is not
        affiliated with the CA as an employee or director <em>and</em> for whom at
        least one of the following statements is true:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  the party is not financially compensated by the CA;</li>
        <li>  the nature and amount of the party’s financial compensation by
          the CA is publicly disclosed; <em>or</em>
        </li>
        <li>  the party is bound by law, government regulation, and/or a
          professional code of ethics to render an honest and objective
          judgement regarding the CA.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>We reserve the right to designate our own representative(s) to act
      as the competent independent party or parties described above,
      should that prove to be necessary and appropriate.</p></li>
    <li><p>The burden is on the CA to prove that it has met the above
      requirements. However the CA may request a preliminary determination
      from us regarding the acceptability of the criteria and/or the
      competent independent party or parties by which it proposes to meet
      the requirements of this policy.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>The publicly-available documentation relating to each audit must contain at
        least the following clearly-labelled information:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a list of the CA policy documents (with version numbers) referenced during
          the audit;</li>
        <li>whether the audit is for a period of time or point in time;</li>
        <li>the start date and end date of the period, for those that cover a period
          of time;</li>
        <li>the point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;</li>
        <li>the date the report was issued (which will necessarily be after the end
          date or point in time date).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For audit reports which are being supplied to maintain a certificate within
        the Mozilla root program, they must be provided to Mozilla within three
        months of the point in time date or the end date of the period.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="application">Applying for Inclusion of Root Certificates in Mozilla Products</h2>

  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for Certification Authorities
    applying for inclusion of their CA Certificates to be distributed in
    Mozilla products:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> We will determine which CA certificates are included in software
      products distributed by Mozilla, based on the benefits and risks of
      such inclusion to typical users of those products.</li>
    <li> We will make such decisions through a public process, based on
      objective and verifiable criteria as described below.</li>
    <li> We will not charge any fees to have a CA’s certificate(s)
      distributed with our software products.</li>
    <li>
      <p>We reserve the right to not include a particular CA certificate in
        our software products. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
        where we believe that including a CA certificate (or setting its
        "trust bits" in a particular way) would cause undue risks to users’
        security, for example, with CAs that</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  knowingly issue certificates without the knowledge of the
          entities whose information is referenced in the certificates;
          <em>or</em>
        </li>
        <li>  knowingly issue certificates that appear to be intended for
          fraudulent use.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This also includes (but again is not limited to) cases where we
        believe that including a CA certificate (or setting its "trust bits"
        in a particular way) might cause technical problems with the
        operation of our software, for example, with CAs that issue
        certificates that have</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>
        <li>  invalid public keys (e.g., RSA certificates with public exponent
          equal to 1);</li>
        <li>  duplicate issuer names and serial numbers (except that a Certificate
          Transparency pre-certificate is allowed to match the corresponding
          certificate);</li>
        <li>  incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude SSL
          usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID and the
          issuer’s issuer name and serial number); <em>or</em>
        </li>
        <li>  cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess extensions for
          which no operational CRL or OCSP service exists.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>We will consider adding additional CA certificates to the
      default certificate set upon request only by an authorized
      representative of the subject CA.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with our
        software products:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  provide some service relevant to typical users of our software
          products;</li>
        <li>  enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of
          directly causing certificate issuance or implement technical
          controls operated by the CA to restrict certificate issuance
          through the account to a limited set of pre-approved domains or
          email addresses;</li>
        <li>  maintain a certificate hierarchy such that the included
          certificate does not directly issue end-entity certificates to
          customers (e.g., the included certificate signs intermediate
          issuing certificates), as described in section 6.1.7 of the
          <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser Forum Baseline
            Requirements</a>;</li>
        <li>  prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate signing
          requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
          purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>
        <li>  verify that all of the information that is included in SSL
          certificates remains current and correct at time intervals of
          thirty-nine months or less; and</li>
        <li>  otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
          deem acceptable.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be
        acceptable if it meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  all information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
          must be verified by using an independent source of information
          or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
          the certificate;</li>
        <li>  for a certificate capable of being used for digitally signing or encrypting
          email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that
          the entity submitting the request controls the email account
          associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
          <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
          the account holder’s behalf;</li>
        <li>  for a certificate capable of being used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
          takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting
          the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s)
          referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized by the
          domain registrant to act on the registrant’s behalf;</li>
        <li>  for certificates marked as Extended
          Validation, the CA complies with the latest version of the
          <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/">Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation
            Certificates</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We reserve the right to use other requirements in the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
        certificates, and which directly or transitively chain to a
        certificate included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program, MUST be
        operated in accordance with Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy
        and MUST either be <strong>technically constrained</strong> or be <strong>publicly
          disclosed and audited.</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>  A certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new
          certificates if it contains an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.1.4">X.509v3 basicConstraints
            extension,</a>
          with the cA boolean set to true. The term "subordinate CA" below
          refers to any organization or legal entity that is in possession
          or control of a certificate that is capable of being used to
          issue new certificates.</li>
        <li>  These requirements include all cross-certified certificates
          which chain to a certificate that is included in Mozilla’s CA
          Certificate Program.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We encourage CAs to technically constrain all subordinate CA
        certificates. For a certificate to be considered <strong>technically
          constrained,</strong> the certificate MUST include an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage
          (EKU)</a>
        extension specifying all extended key usages that the subordinate CA
        is authorized to issue certificates for. The anyExtendedKeyUsage
        KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  If the certificate includes the id-kp-serverAuth extended key usage,
          then the certificate must be Name Constrained as described in section
          7.1.5 of version 1.3 or later of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser Forum Baseline
            Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted
            Certificates</a>.</li>
        <li>  If the certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended
          key usage, then all end-entity certificates MUST only include
          e-mail addresses or mailboxes that the issuing CA has confirmed
          (via technical and/or business controls) that the subordinate CA
          is authorized to use.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>We recognize that technically constraining subordinate CA
      certificates as described above may not be practical in some cases.
      All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
      certificates, that are not technically constrained, and that
      directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in
      Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program MUST be audited in accordance with
      Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy and MUST be publicly disclosed in the
      CCADB by the CA that has their certificate
      included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program. The CA with a
      certificate included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program MUST
      disclose this information before any such subordinate CA is allowed
      to issue certificates. All disclosure MUST be made freely available
      and without additional requirements, including, but not limited to,
      registration, legal agreements, or restrictions on redistribution of
      the certificates in whole or in part.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>We rely on publicly disclosed documentation (e.g., in a Certificate
        Policy and Certification Practice Statement) and publicly disclosed
        audit statements to ascertain that the above requirements are met.
        Therefore, inclusion requests will only be considered if the
        following are true:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  the publicly disclosed documentation provides sufficient
          information for Mozilla to determine whether and how the CA
          complies with this policy, including a description of the steps
          taken by the CA to verify certificate signing requests;</li>
        <li>  the documentation is available from the CA’s official website;</li>
        <li>

      <p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to the default set a CA
        should submit a formal request by submitting a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug
          report</a>
        into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA

        must be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA, and
        should include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
          certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>
        <li>  for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
          the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
          within the certificate hierarchy associated with the CA
          certificate:

          <ul>
            <li>  SSL-enabled servers, <em>or</em>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>  for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
          issues Extended Validation certificates within the certificate hierarchy
          associated with the CA certificate <em>and</em>, if so, the EV policy
          OID associated with the CA certificate;</li>
        <li>  a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (or
          links to a CP and CPS) <em>or</em> equivalent disclosure document(s)
          for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em>
        </li>
        <li>  information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
          stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
          requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
          criteria.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
        information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
        request.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>We have appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Mozilla_CA_Certificate_Policy">CA certificate "module
      owner"</a>
      and (optionally) one or more "peers" to evaluate CA requests on our
      behalf and make decisions regarding all matters relating to CA
      certificates included in our products. CAs or others objecting to a
      particular decision may appeal to the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Governance">Mozilla governance module

  <h2 id="maintenance">Maintaining Confidence in Included Root Certificates</h2>

  <p>This section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    describes the obligations of Certification Authorities for maintaining
    confidence in their root certificates that are included in Mozilla
    Products. This includes regular auditing of the CA’s policies and
    practices; conforming to current CA industry standards and recommended
    best practices; and making changes to included root certificates.</p>

  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for Certification Authorities to
    maintain their CA Certificates that are distributed in Mozilla products:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> CAs are expected to maintain the level of service that was
      established in the <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate
        Policy</a>.</li>
    <li>
      <p>CAs must revoke Certificates that they have issued upon the
        occurrence of any of the following events:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  the subscriber indicates that the original certificate request
          was not authorized and does not retroactively grant
          authorization;</li>
        <li>  the CA obtains reasonable evidence that the subscriber’s private
          key (corresponding to the public key in the certificate) has
          been compromised or is suspected of compromise (e.g. Debian weak
          keys), or that the certificate has been used for a purpose outside
          of that indicated in the certificate or in the CA's subscriber
          agreement;</li>
        <li>  the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that a
          subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations
          under the subscriber agreement;</li>
        <li>  the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any
          circumstance indicating that use of the domain name in the
          certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or
          arbitrator has revoked a subscriber’s right to use the domain
          name listed in the certificate, a relevant licensing or services
          agreement with the registrant has terminated, or the registrant
          of the domain name has failed to renew it);</li>
        <li>  the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of a material
          change in the information contained in the certificate;</li>
        <li>  a determination, in the CA’s sole discretion, that the
          certificate was not issued in accordance with the CA’s
          Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;</li>
        <li>  the CA determines that any of the information appearing in the
          certificate is not accurate, with the exception of the
          organizationalUnitName field, if present.</li>
        <li>  the CA ceases operations for any reason and has not arranged for
          another CA to provide revocation support for the certificate;</li>
        <li>  the CA private key used in issuing the certificate is suspected
          to have been compromised; or</li>
        <li>  such additional revocation events as the CA publishes in its
          policy documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CAs must maintain an online 24x7 repository mechanism whereby
        application software can automatically check online the current
        status of all unexpired certificates issued by the CA.</p>

      <p>For end-entity certificates, CRLs must be updated and reissued at least
        every seven days, and the value of the nextUpdate field shall not be
        more than ten days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.</p>

      <p>For end-entity certificates, if the CA provides revocation information
        via an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>it must update that service at least every four days; and</li>
        <li>responses must have a defined value in the nextUpdate field, and it
          must be no more than ten days after the thisUpdate field; and</li>
        <li>the value in the nextUpdate field must be before or equal to the
          notAfter date of all certificates included within the
          BasicOCSPResponse.certs field or, if the certs field is omitted,
          before or equal to the notAfter date of the CA certificate which
          issued the certificate that the BasicOCSPResponse is for.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with our
      software products notify us when the ownership control of the CA’s
      certificate(s) changes, or when ownership control of the CA’s operations
      changes. To notify us, send email
      to <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>A failure to provide notifications or updates in the CCADB or
      as otherwise required in a timely manner shall be grounds for
      disabling a CA’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla
      products. For this policy and the CCADB policies, "a timely manner" means
      within 30 days of when the appropriate data or documentation becomes
      available to the CA.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>We consider the following algorithms and key sizes to be acceptable in
        root certificates in our root program, and in any certificate which
        chains up to them:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>RSA keys whose modulus size in bits is divisible by 8, and is at
          least 2048.</li>
        <li>Digest algorithms: SHA-1 (see below), SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.</li>
        <li>ECDSA keys using one of the following curve-hash pairs:

          <ul>
            <li>P‐256 with SHA-256</li>
            <li>P‐384 with SHA-384</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>CAs may only sign SHA-1 hashes over end-entity certificates which chain
        up to roots in Mozilla's program if all the following are true:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The end-entity certificate:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>is not within the scope of the Baseline Requirements;</li>
            <li>contains an EKU extension which does not contain either of the id-kp-
              serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage key purposes;</li>
            <li>has at least 64 bits of entropy from a CSPRNG in the serial number.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The issuing certificate:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>contains an EKU extension which does not contain either of the id-kp-
              serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage key purposes;</li>
            <li>has a pathlen:0 constraint.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Point 2 does not apply if the certificate is an OCSP signing certificate
        manually issued directly from a root.</p>

      <p>CAs may only sign SHA-1 hashes over intermediate certificates which
        chain up to roots in Mozilla's program if the certificate to be signed
        is a duplicate of an existing SHA-1 intermediate certificate with the
        only changes being all of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a new key (of the same size);</li>
        <li>a new serial number (of the same length);</li>
        <li>the addition of an EKU and/or a pathlen constraint to meet the
          requirements outlined above.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>CAs may only sign SHA-1 hashes over OCSP responses if the signing
        certificate contains an EKU extension which contains only the
        id-kp-ocspSigning EKU.</p>

      <p>CAs may only sign SHA-1 hashes over CRLs for roots and intermediates
        which have issued SHA-1 certificates.</p>

      <p>CAs may not sign SHA-1 hashes over other data, including CT
        pre-certificates.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We expect CAs to maintain current best practices to prevent
        algorithm attacks against certificates. As such, the following steps
        will be taken:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  software published by Mozilla will return
          an error when a certificate with an MD2, MD4 or MD5-based signature is used;</li>
        <li>  software published by Mozilla will return an error when the
          SSL/TLS certificate has an RSA key size smaller than 2048 bits; and</li>
        <li>  all new certificates must have a serial number greater than zero
          (0) containing at least 64 bits of output from a CSPRNG.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Changes may be made to root certificates that are included in
        Mozilla products as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>  root changes that are motivated by a serious security concern
          such as a major root compromise should be treated as a
          security-sensitive bug, and the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/">Mozilla Policy for Handling Security
            Bugs</a>
          should be followed;</li>
        <li>  enabling a trust bit in a root certificate that is currently
          included, may only be done after careful consideration of the
          CA’s current policies, practices, and audits, according to the
          <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a>,
          and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
          representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
          mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
          page, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply#Enable_Additional_Trust_Bits_for_an_included_root">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla
            products</a>;</li>
        <li>  enabling EV in a root certificate that is currently included,
          may only be done after careful consideration of the CA’s current
          policies, practices, and audits, according to the <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion
            Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate
            Policy</a>,
          and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
          representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
          mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
          page, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply#Enable_Additional_Trust_Bits_for_an_included_root">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla
            products</a>;</li>
        <li>  disabling a root is the act of turning off one or more of the
          trust bits (Websites, Email), and may be
          requested by a representative of the CA or a representative of
          Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla
          system, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change
            Process</a>;</li>
        <li>  a representative of the CA or a representative of Mozilla may
          request that a root certificate be removed by submitting a bug
          report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the
          <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change
            Process</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcing the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</h2>

  <p>This section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to enforce this
    policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and removing or
    disabling a root certificate.</p>

  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for enforcing the Mozilla CA
    Certificate Policy:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root
      compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and
      the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/">Mozilla Policy for Handling Security
        Bugs</a> should
      be followed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Mozilla may, at its sole discretion, disable (partially or fully) or
      remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. Mozilla will
      disable or remove a certificate if the CA demonstrates ongoing or
      egregious practices that do not maintain the level of service that
      was established in the <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA
        Certificate Policy</a>
      or that do not comply with the requirements of the <a href="#maintenance">Maintenance
        Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
      if we learn that a CA has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
      or more certificates. This may include, but is not limited to
      disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all of the CA’s
      certificates from Mozilla’s products. A certificate that includes
      domain names that have not been verified according to section 3.2.2.4 of the
      <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser Forum’s Baseline
        Requirements</a> is
      considered to
      be mis-issued. A certificate that is intended to be used only as an
      end entity certificate but includes a keyUsage extension with values
      keyCertSign and/or cRLSign or a basicConstraints extension with the
      cA field set to true is considered to be mis-issued.</p></li>
    <li><p>A certificate is disabled by turning off one or more of the
      trust bits (Websites, Email). Disablement or removal
      of a certificate may be initiated by submitting a bug report to the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change
        Process</a> or the
      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/">Mozilla Policy for Handling Security
        Bugs</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
      products based on a CA’s actions (or failure to act) that are
      contrary to the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy,
      Mozilla shall publicize that fact in newsgroups on the
      news.mozilla.org server, on Web pages in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a> and
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">www.mozilla.com</a> domains, in news releases sent to organizations
      specializing in computer and Internet news, or as an alert to the
      US-CERT organization of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p></li>
