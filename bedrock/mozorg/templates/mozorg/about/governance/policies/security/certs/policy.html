  <p><em>Version 2.3</em></p>
  <p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
    other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla may include with such software
    a default set of X.509v3 certificates for various Certification Authorities
    (CAs). The certificates included by default have their "trust bits" set for
    various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA certificates
    to verify certificates for SSL servers and S/MIME email users without having
    to ask users for further permission or information.</p>
  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for CA certificates that are distributed
    with Mozilla software products. This policy consists of the following three
    sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#inclusion">Applying for Inclusion of Root Certificates in Mozilla Products</a>
      </p>
      <p>This section describes the obligations of Certification Authorities
        applying for inclusion of their root certificates in Mozilla Products.
        This includes considerations that are taken into account such as the CA’s
        publicly available documentation about their policies, and audits of the
        CA’s operations in support of the documented policies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#maintenance">Maintaining Confidence in Included Root Certificates</a></p>
      <p>This section describes the obligations of Certification Authorities for
        maintaining confidence in their root certificates that are included in
        Mozilla Products. This includes regular auditing of the CA’s policies and
        practices; conforming to current CA industry standards and recommended
        best practices; and making changes to included root certificates.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#enforcement">Enforcing the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a></p>
      <p>This section describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to enforce
        this policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and removing
        or disabling a root certificate.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This policy applies only to software products distributed by Mozilla,
    including the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries. Other entities
    distributing such software are free to adopt their own policies. In
    particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors
    of such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates in the
    versions that they distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of
    the "trust bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. As with
    other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may affect
    its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its versions of the
    software; see the Mozilla trademark policy for more information.</p>
  <p>Please contact Mozilla at
    <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> for more
    information about this policy and answers to related questions.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We will do so only
    after consulting with the public Mozilla community, in order to ensure that
    all views are taken into account.</p>
  <h2 id="inclusion">Applying for Inclusion of Root Certificates in Mozilla Products</h2>
  <p>This section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    describes the obligations of Certification Authorities applying for
    inclusion of their root certificates in Mozilla Products. This includes
    considerations that are taken into account such as the CA’s publicly
    available documentation about their policies, and audits of the CA’s
    operations in support of the documented policies.</p>
  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for Certification Authorities
    applying for inclusion of their CA Certificates to be distributed in
    Mozilla products:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>We will determine which CA certificates are included in software
      products distributed by Mozilla, based on the benefits and risks of
      such inclusion to typical users of those products.
    </li>
    <li>We will make such decisions through a public process, based on
      objective and verifiable criteria as described below.
    </li>
    <li>We will not charge any fees to have a CA’s certificate(s)
      distributed with our software products.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We reserve the right to not include a particular CA certificate in
        our software products. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
        where we believe that including a CA certificate (or setting its
        "trust bits" in a particular way) would cause undue risks to users’
        security, for example, with CAs that</p>
      <ul>
        <li>knowingly issue certificates without the knowledge of the
          entities whose information is referenced in the certificates;
          <em>or</em></li>
        <li>knowingly issue certificates that appear to be intended for
          fraudulent use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This also includes (but again is not limited to) cases where we
        believe that including a CA certificate (or setting its "trust bits"
        in a particular way) might cause technical problems with the
        operation of our software, for example, with CAs that issue
        certificates that have
        - ASN.1 DER encoding errors;
        - invalid public keys (e.g., RSA certificates with public exponent
        equal to 1);
        - duplicate issuer names and serial numbers;
        - incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude SSL
        usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID and the
        issuer’s issuer name and serial number); <em>or</em>
        - cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess extensions for
        which no operational CRL or OCSP service exists.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We will consider adding certificates for additional CAs to the
        default certificate set upon request only by an authorized
        representative of the subject CA.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with our
        software products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide some service relevant to typical users of our software
          products;
        </li>
        <li>publicly disclose information about their policies and business
          practices (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and Certification
          Practice Statement);
        </li>
        <li>enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of
          directly causing certificate issuance or implement technical
          controls operated by the CA to restrict certificate issuance
          through the account to a limited set of pre-approved domains or
          email addresses;
        </li>
        <li>maintain a certificate hierarchy such that the included
          certificate does not directly issue end-entity certificates to
          customers (e.g., the included certificate signs intermediate
          issuing certificates), as described in section 6.1.7 of the
          <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser Forum Baseline
            Requirements</a>;
        </li>
        <li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate signing
          requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
          purpose(s) of the certificates;
        </li>
        <li>verify that all of the information that is included in SSL
          certificates remains current and correct at time intervals of
          thirty-nine months or less;
        </li>
        <li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
          deem acceptable; <em>and</em></li>
        <li>provide public attestation of their conformance to the stated
          verification requirements and other operational criteria by a
          competent independent party or parties with access to details of
          the CA’s internal operations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be
        acceptable if it meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>all information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
          must be verified by using an independent source of information
          or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
          the certificate;
        </li>
        <li>for a certificate to be used for digitally signing or encrypting
          email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that
          the entity submitting the request controls the email account
          associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
          <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
          the account holder’s behalf;
        </li>
        <li>for a certificate to be used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
          takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting
          the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s)
          referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized by the
          domain registrant to act on the registrant’s behalf;
        </li>
        <li>for certificates to be used for and marked as Extended
          Validation, the CA complies with <a href="http://www.cabforum.org/documents.html">Guidelines
            for the Issuance
            and Management of Extended Validation
            Certificates</a> version
          1.4 or later.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to use other requirements in the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
        certificates, and which directly or transitively chain to a
        certificate included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program, MUST be
        operated in accordance with Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy
        and MUST either be <strong>technically constrained</strong> or be <strong>publicly
          disclosed and audited.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new
          certificates if it contains an <a
              href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.1.4">X.509v3 basicConstraints
            extension,</a>
          with the cA boolean set to true. The term "subordinate CA" below
          refers to any organization or legal entity that is in possession
          or control of a certificate that is capable of being used to
          issue new certificates.
        </li>
        <li>These requirements include all cross-certified certificates
          which chain to a certificate that is included in Mozilla’s CA
          Certificate Program.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We encourage CAs to technically constrain all subordinate CA
        certificates. For a certificate to be considered <strong>technically
          constrained,</strong> the certificate MUST include an <a
            href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage
          (EKU)</a>
        extension specifying all extended key usages that the subordinate CA
        is authorized to issue certificates for. The anyExtendedKeyUsage
        KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the certificate includes the id-kp-serverAuth extended key usage,
          then the certificate must be Name Constrained as described in section
          7.1.5 of version 1.3 or later of the <a
              href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser Forum
            Baseline
            Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted
            Certificates</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If the certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended
          key usage, then all end-entity certificates MUST only include
          e-mail addresses or mailboxes that the issuing CA has confirmed
          (via technical and/or business controls) that the subordinate CA
          is authorized to use.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We recognize that technically constraining subordinate CA
        certificates as described above may not be practical in some cases.
        All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
        certificates, that are not technically constrained, and that
        directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in
        Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program MUST be audited in accordance with
        Mozilla’s CA Certificate Policy
        and MUST be publicly disclosed by the CA that has their certificate
        included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program. The CA with a
        certificate included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program MUST
        disclose this information before any such subordinate CA is allowed
        to issue certificates. All disclosure MUST be made freely available
        and without additional requirements, including, but not limited to,
        registration, legal agreements, or restrictions on redistribution of
        the certificates in whole or in part. The Certificate Policy or
        Certification Practice Statement of the CA that has their
        certificate included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program must
        specify where on that CA’s website all such public disclosures are
        located. For a certificate to be considered <strong>publicly disclosed and
          audited,</strong> the following information MUST be provided:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The full DER-encoded X.509 certificate (Each issuing CA should
          provide one .p7c, .zip, or .tgz file containing all of the
          non-technically-constrained intermediate certificates that it
          has signed.);
        </li>
        <li>The corresponding Certificate Policy or Certification Practice
          Statement used by the subordinate CA; <em>and</em></li>
        <li>Annual public attestation of conformance to the stated
          certificate verification requirements and other operational
          criteria by a competent independent party or parties with access
          to the details of the subordinate CA’s internal operations.
        </li>
      </ul>

        authorized to perform audits according to the stated criteria (e.g.,
        by the organization responsible for the criteria or by a relevant
        government agency) <em>or</em> for whom there is sufficient public
        information available to determine that the party is competent to
        judge the CA’s conformance to the stated criteria. In the latter
        case the "public information" referred to should include information
        regarding the party’s</p>

        least one of the following statements is true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the party is not financially compensated by the CA;</li>

      from us regarding the acceptability of the criteria and/or the
      competent independent party or parties by which it proposes to meet
      the requirements of this policy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We rely on publicly disclosed documentation (e.g., in a Certificate
        Policy and Certification Practice Statement) and publicly disclosed
        audit statements to ascertain that the above requirements are met.
        Therefore, inclusion requests will only be considered if the
        following are true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the publicly disclosed documentation provides sufficient
          information for Mozilla to determine whether and how the CA
          complies with this policy, including a description of the steps
          taken by the CA to verify certificate signing requests;
        </li>
        <li>the documentation is available from the CA’s official website;
          and
        </li>
        <li>the public attestation of the CA’s conformance to the stated
          verification requirements by a competent independent party
          indicates which policy documents were included in the review.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to the default set a CA
        should submit a formal request by submitting a <a
            href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug
          report</a>
        into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA
        Certificates" component of the "mozilla.org" product. Mozilla’s wiki
        page, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply">Applying for root inclusion in
          Mozilla
          products</a>, provides
        further details about how to submit a formal request. The request
        must be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA, and
        should include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
          certificate(s) requested for inclusion;
        </li>
        <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
          the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
          within the CA hierarchy associated with the CA certificate:
          <ul>
            <li>SSL-enabled servers, <em>or</em></li>
            <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
          issues Extended Validation certificates within the CA hierarchy
          associated with the CA certificate <em>and</em>, if so, the EV policy
          OID associated with the CA certificate;
        </li>
        <li>a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (or
          links to a CP and CPS) <em>or</em> equivalent disclosure document(s)
          for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em></li>
        <li>information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
          stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
          requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
          criteria.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
        information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
        request.

  <h2 id="maintenance">Maintaining Confidence in Included Root Certificates</h2>
  <p>This section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    describes the obligations of Certification Authorities for maintaining
    confidence in their root certificates that are included in Mozilla
    Products. This includes regular auditing of the CA’s policies and
    practices; conforming to current CA industry standards and recommended
    best practices; and making changes to included root certificates.</p>
  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for Certification Authorities to
    maintain their CA Certificates that are distributed in Mozilla products:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>CAs are expected to maintain the level of service that was
      established in the <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate
        Policy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CAs must revoke Certificates that they have issued upon the
        occurrence of any of the following events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the subscriber indicates that the original certificate request
          was not authorized and does not retroactively grant
          authorization;
        </li>
        <li>the CA obtains reasonable evidence that the subscriber’s private
          key (corresponding to the public key in the certificate) has
          been compromised or is suspected of compromise (e.g. Debian weak
          keys), or that the certificate has otherwise been misused;
        </li>
        <li>the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that a
          subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations
          under the subscriber agreement;
        </li>
        <li>the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any
          circumstance indicating that use of the domain name in the
          certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or
          arbitrator has revoked a subscriber’s right to use the domain
          name listed in the certificate, a relevant licensing or services
          agreement with the registrant has terminated, or the registrant
          of the domain name has failed to renew it);
        </li>
        <li>the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of a material
          change in the information contained in the certificate;
        </li>
        <li>a determination, in the CA’s sole discretion, that the
          certificate was not issued in accordance with the CA’s
          Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;
        </li>
        <li>the CA determines that any of the information appearing in the
          certificate is not accurate, with the exception of the
          organizationalUnitName field, if present.
        </li>
        <li>the CA ceases operations for any reason and has not arranged for
          another CA to provide revocation support for the certificate;
        </li>
        <li>the CA private key used in issuing the certificate is suspected
          to have been compromised; or
        </li>
        <li>such additional revocation events as the CA publishes in its
          policy documentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CAs must maintain an online 24x7 repository mechanism whereby
        application software can automatically check online the current
        status of all unexpired certificates issued by the CA. For
        end-entity certificates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CRLs must be updated and reissued at least every seven days, and
          the value of the nextUpdate field shall not be more than ten
          days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field; or
        </li>
        <li>if the CA provides revocation information via an Online
          Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service, it must update that
          service at least every four days. OCSP responses from this
          service must have a maximum expiration time of ten days.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with our
        software products provide us an updated statement annually of
        attestation of their conformance to the stated verification
        requirements and other operational criteria by a competent
        independent party or parties, as outlined in this policy. To notify
        us of an updated statement of attestation, send email to
        <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> or
        submit a bug report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed
        against the "CA Certificates" component of the "mozilla.org"
        product. The request should include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the certificate data identifying the CA certificate(s) to which
          the updated statement of attestation applies;
        </li>
        <li>a copy of (or link to) the updated statement of attestation
          (e.g., "Auditor’s Report and Management Assertions" or
          equivalent document); and
        </li>
        <li>contact information for the party making the attestation, if the
          statement is not posted on an independent website (e.g.
          cert.webtrust.org).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with our
        software products notify us when its policies and business practices
        change in regards to verification procedures for issuing
        certificates, when the ownership control of the CA’s certificate(s)
        changes, or when ownership control of the CA’s operations changes.
        To notify us of updated policies and business practices, send email
        to <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> or
        submit a bug report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed
        against the "CA Certificates" component of the "mozilla.org"
        product. The request should include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the certificate data identifying the CA certificate(s) that are
          affected by the change;
        </li>
        <li>copies of (or links to) the updated Certificate Policy or
          Certification Practice Statement document(s) or equivalent
          disclosure document(s); and
        </li>
        <li>a summary of the changes that impact the verification procedures
          for issuing certificates.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with our
        software products ensure that we have their current contact
        information. If the CA’s primary representative for their included
        root certificates leaves the organization, then the burden is on the
        CA to inform Mozilla of the contact information for the new primary
        representative, by sending email to
        <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a>. If we
        are not able to contact a CA, or do not have current audit and
        policy documentation, then the CA’s root certificates may be
        disabled or removed as described in the <a href="#enforcement">Enforcement Section of the
          Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>A failure to provide required notifications or updates as specified
      in items #4, #5, and #6 in a timely manner shall be grounds for
      disabling a CA’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla
      products. For this policy "a timely manner" means within 30 days of
      when the appropriate data or documentation becomes available to the
      CA.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We consider the following algorithms and key sizes to be acceptable
        and supported in Mozilla products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SHA-1 (until a practical collision attack against SHA-1
          certificates is imminent);
        </li>
        <li>SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512;</li>
        <li>Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (using ANSI X9.62)
          over SECG and NIST named curves P-256, P-384, and P-512;
        </li>
        <li>RSA 2048 bits or higher; and</li>
        <li>RSA 1024 bits (only until December 31, 2013).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We expect CAs to maintain current best practices to prevent
        algorithm attacks against certificates. As such, the following steps
        will be taken:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>software published by Mozilla will return
          an error when a certificate with an MD2, MD4 or MD5-based signature is used;
        </li>
        <li>software published by Mozilla will return an error when the
          SSL/TLS certificate has an RSA key size smaller than 2048 bits; and
        </li>
        <li>all new end-entity certificates must contain at least 20 bits of
          unpredictable random data (preferably in the serial number).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Changes may be made to root certificates that are included in
        Mozilla products as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>root changes that are motivated by a serious security concern
          such as a major root compromise should be treated as a
          security-sensitive bug, and the <a

        <li>enabling a trust bit in a root certificate that is currently
          included, may only be done after careful consideration of the

  <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcing the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</h2>
  <p>This section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to enforce this
    policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and removing or
    disabling a root certificate.</p>
  <p>This is the official Mozilla policy for enforcing the Mozilla CA
    Certificate Policy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root
        compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and
        the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/">Mozilla
          Policy for Handling Security
          Bugs</a> should
        be followed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mozilla may, at its sole discretion, disable (partially or fully) or
        remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. Mozilla will
        disable or remove a certificate if the CA demonstrates ongoing or
        egregious practices that do not maintain the level of service that
        was established in the <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA
          Certificate Policy</a>
        or that do not comply with the requirements of the <a href="#maintenance">Maintenance
          Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
        if we learn that a CA has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
        or more certificates. This may include, but is not limited to
        disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all of the CA’s
        certificates from Mozilla’s products. A certificate that includes
        domain names that have not been verified according to section 3.2.2.4 of the
        <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser Forum’s Baseline
          Requirements</a> is
        considered to
        be mis-issued. A certificate that is intended to be used only as an
        end entity certificate but includes a keyUsage extension with values
        keyCertSign and/or cRLSign or a basicConstraints extension with the
        cA field set to true is considered to be mis-issued.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A certificate is disabled by turning off one or more of the
        trust bits (Websites, Email). Disablement or removal
        of a certificate may be initiated by submitting a bug report to the
        mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the <a
            href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change
          Process</a> or the

          Policy for Handling Security
          Bugs</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
        products based on a CA’s actions (or failure to act) that are
        contrary to the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy,
        Mozilla shall publicize that fact in newsgroups on the
        news.mozilla.org server, on Web pages in the www.mozilla.org and
        www.mozilla.com domains, in news releases sent to organizations
        specializing in computer and Internet news, or as an alert to the
        US-CERT organization of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
