  <p><em>Version 2.4.1</em></p>

  <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

  <p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
    other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla includes with such software
    a set of X.509v3 root certificates for various Certification
    Authorities (CAs). The included certificates have their "trust bits"
    set for various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
    certificates to anchor a chain of trust for certificates used by SSL servers
    and S/MIME email users without having to ask users for further permission or
    information.</p>

  <p>This policy covers how the default set of certificates and associated trust
    bits is maintained for software products distributed by Mozilla. Other entities
    distributing software based on ours are free to adopt their own policies. In
    particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors
    of such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates in the
    versions that they distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of
    the trust bits on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. However,
    as with other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor MAY
    well affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
    versions of the software. See the Mozilla trademark policy for more
    information.</p>

  <h3 id="scope">1.1 Scope</h3>

  <p>This policy applies, as appropriate, to certificates matching any of the
    following (and the CAs which control or issue them):</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>CA certificates applying for inclusion in, or included in, the Mozilla root
      store.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Intermediate certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate and which are not technically constrained such
        that they are unable to issue working server or email certificates. Such
        technical constraints could consist of either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which does not contain either of
          the id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-emailProtection EKUs; or:</li>
        <li>name constraints which do not allow SANs of any of the following types:
          dNSName, iPAddress, SRVName, rfc822Name</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>End-entity certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate through intermediate certificates which are all in
        scope, such end-entity certificates having either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which contains one or more of the
          id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-emailProtection EKUs; or:</li>
        <li>no EKU extension.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>

  <h3 id="ownership">1.2 Policy Ownership</h3>

  <p>Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Mozilla_CA_Certificate_Policy">CA Certificate module owner</a>
    and peers to evaluate new CA requests on our behalf and make decisions
    regarding all matters relating to CA certificates included in our products.</p>

  <p>The CA Certificate module team may change this policy in the future. We will do
    so only after consulting with the public Mozilla community, in order to ensure
    that all views are taken into account. CAs or others objecting to a particular
    decision MAY appeal to the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Governance">Mozilla governance module owner</a>
    who will make a final decision.</p>

  <p>You can contact the CA Certificate module team at
    <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> if you have questions about this policy.</p>

  <h2 id="certificate-authorities">2. Certificate Authorities</h2>

  <h3 id="ca-operations">2.1 CA Operations</h3>

  <p>CAs whose certificates are distributed with our software products MUST:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> provide some service relevant to typical users of our software
      products;</li>
    <li> enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of
      directly causing certificate issuance, or implement technical
      controls operated by the CA to restrict certificate issuance
      through the account to a limited set of pre-approved domains or
      email addresses;</li>
    <li> prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate signing
      requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
      purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>
    <li> verify that all of the information that is included in SSL
      certificates remains current and correct at time intervals of
      thirty-nine months or less; and</li>
    <li> otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
      deem acceptable.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="validation">2.2 Validation Practices</h3>

  <p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be acceptable if it
    meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> all information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
      MUST be verified by using an independent source of information
      or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
      the certificate;</li>
    <li> for a certificate capable of being used for digitally signing or encrypting
      email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that
      the entity submitting the request controls the email account
      associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
      <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
      the account holder’s behalf;</li>
    <li> for a certificate capable of being used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
      takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting
      the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s)
      referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized by the
      domain registrant to act on the registrant’s behalf;</li>
    <li> for certificates marked as Extended
      Validation, the CA MUST comply with the latest version of the
      <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/">Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation
        Certificates</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="conformance">2.3 Baseline Requirements Conformance</h3>

  <p>CA operations relating to issuance of certificates capable of being used for
    SSL-enabled servers MUST also conform to the latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser
      Forum Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted
      Certificates</a> ("Baseline Requirements"). In the event of inconsistency
    between Mozilla’s Root Store Policy requirements and the Baseline Requirements,
    Mozilla’s Root Store Policy takes precedence. The following is a list of known
    places where this policy takes precedence over the Baseline Requirements. If
    you find an inconsistency that is not listed here, notify Mozilla so the item
    can be considered for addition or clarification.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>  Mozilla’s definitions of a "competent" and "independent" auditor in section
      3.2 of this document are a superset of definitions in section 8.2 of the
      Baseline Requirements, and take precedence over them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="documentation">3. Documentation</h2>

  <h3 id="audits">3.1 Audits</h3>

  <p>Before being included and periodically thereafter, CAs MUST obtain certain
    audits. This section describes the requirements for those audits.</p>

  <h4 id="public-audit-information">3.1.3 Public Audit Information</h4>

  <p>The publicly-available documentation relating to each audit MUST contain at
    least the following clearly-labelled information:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> a list of the CA policy documents (with version numbers) referenced during
      the audit;</li>
    <li> whether the audit is for a period of time or point in time;</li>
    <li> the start date and end date of the period, for those that cover a period
      of time;</li>
    <li> the point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;</li>
    <li> the date the report was issued (which will necessarily be after the end
      date or point in time date).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For audit reports which are being supplied to maintain a certificate within
    the Mozilla root program, they MUST be provided to Mozilla within three
    months of the point in time date or the end date of the period.</p>

  <h3 id="auditors">3.2 Auditors</h3>

  <p>Mozilla requires that audits MUST be performed by a competent independent
    party.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to designate our own representative(s) to act
    as the competent independent party or parties described below,
    should that prove to be necessary and appropriate.</p>

  <p>The burden is on the CA to prove that it has met the below
    requirements. However the CA MAY request a preliminary determination
    from us regarding the acceptability of the criteria and/or the
    competent independent party or parties by which it proposes to meet
    the requirements of this policy.</p>

  <h4 id="competent-party">3.2.1 Competent Party</h4>

  <p>By "competent party" we mean a person or other entity who is
    authorized to perform audits according to the stated criteria (e.g.,
    by the organization responsible for the criteria or by a relevant
    government agency) <em>or</em> for whom there is sufficient public
    information available to determine that the party is competent to
    judge the CA’s conformance to the stated criteria. In the latter
    case the "public information" referred to SHOULD include information
    regarding the party’s:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> knowledge of CA-related technical issues such as public key
      cryptography and related standards;</li>
    <li> experience in performing security-related audits, evaluations,
      or risk analyses; <em>and</em>
    </li>
    <li> honesty and objectivity.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="independent-party">3.2.2 Independent Party</h4>

  <p>By "independent party" we mean a person or other entity who is not
    affiliated with the CA as an employee or director <em>and</em> for whom at
    least one of the following statements is true:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> the party is not financially compensated by the CA;</li>
    <li> the nature and amount of the party’s financial compensation by
      the CA is publicly disclosed; <em>or</em>
    </li>
    <li> the party is bound by law, government regulation, and/or a
      professional code of ethics to render an honest and objective
      judgement regarding the CA.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="cpses">3.3 CPs and CPSes</h3>

  <p>We rely on publicly disclosed documentation (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and
    Certification Practice Statement) to ascertain that our requirements are met.
    Therefore, the following MUST be true:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>the publicly disclosed documentation provides sufficient
      information for Mozilla to determine whether and how the CA
      complies with this policy, including a description of the steps
      taken by the CA to verify certificate signing requests;</p></li>
    <li><p>the documentation is available from the CA’s official website;</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>CPs and CPSes are made available to Mozilla under one
        of the following Creative Commons licenses (or later versions):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Attribution (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a>) 4.0</li>
        <li>Attribution-ShareAlike (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>) 4.0</li>
        <li>Attribution-NoDerivs (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a>) 4.0</li>
        <li>Public Domain Dedication (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC-0</a>) 1.0</li>
      </ul>

      <p>or a set of equally permissive licensing terms accepted by Mozilla in
        writing. If no such license is indicated, the fact of application is
        considered as permission from the CA to allow Mozilla and the public to
        deal with these documents, and any later versions for root certificates
        which are included in Mozilla's trust store, under CC-BY-ND 4.0.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="common-ca-database">4. Common CA Database</h2>

  <p>Mozilla manages its root store using the Common CA Database (CCADB). CAs in the
    program MUST use the CCADB, and are bound by the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pkipolicy/tree/2.4.1/ccadb/policy.md">Common CCADB Policy
      v1.0</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pkipolicy/tree/2.4.1/ccadb/mozilla.md">Mozilla CCADB Policy
      v1.0</a>, which are incorporated here by reference.</p>

  <h2 id="certificates">5. Certificates</h2>

  <h3 id="algorithms">5.1 Algorithms</h3>

  <p>Root certificates in our root program, and any certificate which
    chains up to them, MUST use only algorithms and key sizes from the following
    set:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>  RSA keys whose modulus size in bits is divisible by 8, and is at
      least 2048.</li>
    <li>  Digest algorithms: SHA-1 (see below), SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.</li>
    <li>  ECDSA keys using one of the following curve-hash pairs:

      <ul>
        <li>P‐256 with SHA-256</li>
        <li>P‐384 with SHA-384</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="sha-1">5.1.1 SHA-1</h4>

  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over end-entity certificates which chain
    up to roots in Mozilla's program only if all the following are true:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The end-entity certificate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>is not within the scope of the Baseline Requirements;</li>
        <li>contains an EKU extension which does not contain either of the id-kp-
          serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage key purposes;</li>
        <li>has at least 64 bits of entropy from a CSPRNG in the serial number.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The issuing certificate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>contains an EKU extension which does not contain either of the id-kp-
          serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage key purposes;</li>
        <li>has a pathlen:0 constraint.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Point 2 does not apply if the certificate is an OCSP signing certificate
    manually issued directly from a root.</p>

  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over intermediate certificates which
    chain up to roots in Mozilla's program only if the certificate to be signed
    is a duplicate of an existing SHA-1 intermediate certificate with the
    only changes being all of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>  a new key (of the same size);</li>
    <li>  a new serial number (of the same length);</li>
    <li>  the addition of an EKU and/or a pathlen constraint to meet the
      requirements outlined above.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over OCSP responses only if the signing
    certificate contains an EKU extension which contains only the
    id-kp-ocspSigning EKU.</p>

  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over CRLs for roots and intermediates
    only if they have issued SHA-1 certificates.</p>

  <p>CAs MUST NOT sign SHA-1 hashes over other data, including CT pre-certificates.</p>

  <h3 id="forbidden-and-required-practices">5.2 Forbidden and Required Practices</h3>

  <p>CAs MUST maintain a certificate hierarchy such that the included
    certificate does not directly issue end-entity certificates to
    customers (i.e. the included certificate signs intermediate
    issuing certificates), as described in section 6.1.7 of the
    <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>

  <p>CAs MUST maintain current best practices to prevent
    algorithm attacks against certificates. As such, all new certificates
    MUST have a serial number greater than zero, containing at least 64 bits of
    output from a CSPRNG.</p>

  <p>CAs MUST NOT issue certificates that have:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>  ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>
    <li>  invalid public keys (e.g., RSA certificates with public exponent
      equal to 1);</li>
    <li>  duplicate issuer names and serial numbers (except that a Certificate
      Transparency pre-certificate is allowed to match the corresponding
      certificate);</li>
    <li>  incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude SSL
      usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID and the
      issuer’s issuer name and serial number); <em>or</em>
    </li>
    <li>  cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess extensions for
      which no operational CRL or OCSP service exists.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="intermediate-certificates">5.3 Intermediate Certificates</h3>

  <p>All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates, and
    which directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in Mozilla’s CA
    Certificate Program, MUST be operated in accordance with this policy and MUST
    either be technically constrained or be publicly disclosed and audited.</p>

  <p>A certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new
    certificates if it contains an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.1.4">X.509v3 basicConstraints extension</a>
    with the cA boolean set to true. The term "subordinate CA" in this section
    refers to any organization or legal entity that is in possession
    or control of a certificate that is capable of being used to
    issue new certificates.</p>

  <p>These requirements include all cross-certified certificates
    which chain to a certificate that is included in Mozilla’s CA
    Certificate Program.</p>

  <h4 id="technically-constrained">5.3.1 Technically Constrained</h4>

  <p>We encourage CAs to technically constrain all subordinate CA
    certificates. For a certificate to be considered technically
    constrained, the certificate MUST include an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage
      (EKU)</a> extension specifying all extended key usages that the
    subordinate CA is authorized to issue certificates for. The anyExtendedKeyUsage
    KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension.</p>

  <p>If the certificate includes the id-kp-serverAuth extended key usage,
    then the certificate MUST be Name Constrained as described in section
    7.1.5 of version 1.3 or later of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>

  <p>If the certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended
    key usage, then all end-entity certificates MUST only include
    e-mail addresses or mailboxes that the issuing CA has confirmed
    (via technical and/or business controls) that the subordinate CA
    is authorized to use.</p>

  <h4 id="publicly-disclosed-and-audited">5.3.2 Publicly Disclosed and Audited</h4>

  <p>We recognize that technically constraining subordinate CA
    certificates as described above may not be practical in some cases.
    All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
    certificates, that are not technically constrained, and that
    directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in
    Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program MUST be audited in accordance with
    Mozilla’s Root Store Policy and MUST be publicly disclosed in the
    CCADB by the CA that has their certificate
    included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program. The CA with a
    certificate included in Mozilla’s CA Certificate Program MUST
    disclose this information before any such subordinate CA is allowed
    to issue certificates. All disclosure MUST be made freely available
    and without additional requirements, including, but not limited to,
    registration, legal agreements, or restrictions on redistribution of
    the certificates in whole or in part.</p>

  <h2 id="revocation">6. Revocation</h2>

  <p>CAs MUST revoke Certificates that they have issued upon the
    occurrence of any of the following events:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> the subscriber indicates that the original certificate request
      was not authorized and does not retroactively grant
      authorization;</li>
    <li> the CA obtains reasonable evidence that the subscriber’s private
      key (corresponding to the public key in the certificate) has
      been compromised or is suspected of compromise (e.g. Debian weak
      keys);</li>
    <li> the CA obtains reasonable evidence that the certificate has been used for a
      purpose outside of that indicated in the certificate or in the CA's
      subscriber agreement;</li>
    <li> the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that a
      subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations
      under the subscriber agreement;</li>
    <li> the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any
      circumstance indicating that use of the domain name in the
      certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or
      arbitrator has revoked a subscriber’s right to use the domain
      name listed in the certificate, a relevant licensing or services
      agreement with the registrant has terminated, or the registrant
      of the domain name has failed to renew it);</li>
    <li> the CA receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of a material
      change in the information contained in the certificate;</li>
    <li> a determination, in the CA’s sole discretion, that the
      certificate was not issued in accordance with the CA’s
      Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;</li>
    <li> the CA determines that any of the information appearing in the
      certificate is not accurate, with the exception of the
      organizationalUnitName field, if present;</li>
    <li> the CA ceases operations for any reason and has not arranged for
      another CA to provide revocation support for the certificate;</li>
    <li>the CA private key used in issuing the certificate is suspected
      to have been compromised; or</li>
    <li>such additional revocation events as the CA publishes in its
      policy documentation.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>CAs MUST maintain an online 24x7 repository mechanism whereby
    application software can automatically check online the current
    status of all unexpired certificates issued by the CA.</p>

  <p>For end-entity certificates, CRLs MUST be updated and reissued at least
    every seven days, and the value of the nextUpdate field MUST NOT be
    more than ten days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.</p>

  <p>For end-entity certificates, if the CA provides revocation information
    via an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>  it MUST update that service at least every four days; and</li>
    <li>  responses MUST have a defined value in the nextUpdate field, and it
      MUST be no more than ten days after the thisUpdate field; and</li>
    <li>  the value in the nextUpdate field MUST be before or equal to the
      notAfter date of all certificates included within the
      BasicOCSPResponse.certs field or, if the certs field is omitted,
      before or equal to the notAfter date of the CA certificate which
      issued the certificate that the BasicOCSPResponse is for.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="root-store-changes">7. Root Store Changes</h2>

  <p>Changes that are motivated by a serious security concern
    such as a major root compromise SHOULD be treated as a
    security-sensitive bug, and the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/">Mozilla Policy for Handling Security
      Bugs</a> SHOULD be followed.</p>

  <h3 id="inclusions">7.1 Inclusions</h3>

  <p>We will determine which CA certificates are included in software
    products distributed by Mozilla, based on the benefits and risks of
    such inclusion to typical users of those products. We will consider adding
    additional CA certificates to the default certificate set upon request only by
    an authorized representative of the subject CA. We will make such decisions
    through a public process, based on objective and verifiable criteria.</p>

  <p>We will not charge any fees to have a CA’s certificate(s)
    distributed with our software products.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to not include certificates from a particular CA in
    our software products. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
    where we believe that a CA has caused undue risks to users’
    security, for example, by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>  knowingly issue certificates without the knowledge of the
      entities whose information is referenced in the certificates; or</li>
    <li>  knowingly issue certificates that appear to be intended for
      fraudulent use.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to the default set a CA
    SHOULD submit a formal request by submitting a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug report</a>
    into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA
    Certificates" component of the "mozilla.org" product. Mozilla’s wiki
    page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>", provides
    further details about how to submit a formal request. The request
    MUST be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA, and
    MUST include the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
      certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>
    <li> for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
      the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
      within the certificate hierarchy associated with the CA
      certificate:

      <ul>
        <li>SSL-enabled servers</li>
        <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
      issues Extended Validation certificates within the certificate hierarchy
      associated with the CA certificate and, if so, the EV policy
      OID associated with the CA certificate;</li>
    <li> a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (or
      links to a CP and CPS) or equivalent disclosure document(s)
      for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em>
    </li>
    <li> information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
      stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
      requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
      criteria.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
    information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
    request.</p>

  <h3 id="updates">7.2 Updates</h3>

  <p>Changes MAY be made to root certificates that are included in
    Mozilla products as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> enabling a trust bit in a root certificate that is currently
      included, may only be done after careful consideration of the
      CA’s current policies, practices, and audits,
      and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
    <li> enabling EV in a root certificate that is currently included,
      may only be done after careful consideration of the CA’s current
      policies, practices, and audits,
      and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
    <li> disabling a root is the act of turning off one or more of the
      trust bits (Websites, Email), and may be
      requested by a representative of the CA or a representative of
      Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla
      system, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>;</li>
    <li> a representative of the CA or a representative of Mozilla may
      request that a root certificate be removed by submitting a bug
      report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the
      <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="removals">7.3 Removals</h3>

  <p>Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, disable (partially or fully) or
    remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. Mozilla will
    disable or remove a certificate if the CA demonstrates ongoing or
    egregious practices that do not maintain the expected level of service
    or that do not comply with the requirements of this policy.</p>

  <p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
    if we learn that a CA has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
    or more certificates. This may include, but is not limited to
    disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all of the CA’s
    certificates from Mozilla’s products. A certificate that includes
    domain names that have not been verified according to section 3.2.2.4 of the
    <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a> is considered to be mis-issued. A certificate
    that is intended to be used only as an end entity certificate but includes a
    keyUsage extension with values keyCertSign and/or cRLSign or a basicConstraints
    extension with the cA field set to true is considered to be mis-issued.</p>

  <p>A failure to provide notifications or updates in the CCADB or
    as otherwise required in a timely manner SHALL also be grounds for
    disabling a CA’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla
    products. For this policy and the CCADB policies, "a timely manner" means
    within 30 days of when the appropriate data or documentation becomes
    available to the CA, unless a policy specifies a different rule.</p>

  <p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
    products based on a CA’s actions (or failure to act) that are
    contrary to the Mozilla Root Store Policy,
    Mozilla will publicize that fact in newsgroups on the
    news.mozilla.org server, on Web pages in the mozilla.org and
    mozilla.com domains, in news releases sent to organizations
    specializing in computer and Internet news, and/or as an alert to the
    US-CERT organization of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>

  <h3 id="transfers">7.4 Transfers</h3>

  <p>All CAs whose certificates are distributed with our software products MUST
    notify us when the ownership control of the CA’s certificate(s) changes, or
    when ownership control of the CA’s operations changes. To notify us, send email
    to <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a>.</p>
